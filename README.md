# Australian Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Contribution Analysis

This project follows the CRISP-DM process to provide an analysis for contribution in Australian Self-Managed Super Fund.

### 1. Business Understanding
A self-managed super fund, or SMSF for short, is a do-it-yourself superannuation scheme designed for those who want direct control over their retirement savings and investments. This analysis is based on over 3 million contribution transactions, and targeting to find relationships between transaction date, amount, contributors' location and contribution type. 

### 2. Data Understanding
Data are collected from a MySQL database, by selecting and joining transaction, people and addresses information. It is expecting that most data (over 99%) is clean and completed. Data includes transaction Id, date, amount, split amount in different contribution types, people birthday and people address (suburb, state and country).

### 3. Prepare Data
First, fake data will be removed by fake account idï¼Œ unrealistic birthday, and unrealistic amount.
Second, data will be removed if birthday or address is missing, since the missing rate is less than 1%.
Third, unrelated columns will be removed.

### 4. Data Modelling
This part is using bar chart and histogram to analyse the acount and trend for people's contribution, and trying to find relationship among data.

### 5. Evaluate the Results
The result tells that 1960s are the major contributors in SMSF. Also, it could be a big contribution gap for people living in different state. 
In the future, it is expected to combine both contribution and investment returns to give a prediction in super performance.
